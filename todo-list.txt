ORIGINAL TO-DO LIST FOLLOWS...

Okay I'm really gonna have to keep up to date on this. Here's some shit I could do to ww-cash2...

HIGH PRIORITY:
* The rest of the weapons need adding.
-- In slot 2:
---- I'm...really not happy with that Magnum. (see Aesthetics)
---- Maybe bring back the silenced pistol, a bit less broken this time?
---- How about a Kampfpistole-type grenade launcher, just to give the rich player something to spend on? (And maybe have it use the same ammo as the one in slot 5?)
-- In slot 3:
---- Some kind of varmint rifle (semi or straight-pull bolt-action? Hmm, there's graphics for the latter that Chronoteeth made for the abandoned ww-terror addon) with a scope upgrade maybe?
-- In slot 4:
---- Battle Rifle needs its upgrade implemented (find or draw graphics for the launcher attachment!)
---- A Heavy Machine Gun that takes the Battle Rifle ammo (quicker ROF but much less ammo efficient)
---- AA12-style autoshotgun that takes shotgun shells (less damage but quicker to shoot/reload than the upgraded Shorty?).
-- In slot 5: Find better sprites for the Recoilless, add disposable LAWs and the incendiary rockets.
---- Recoilless needs new graphics and behavior and needs to generally suck a lot less.
---- Disposable LAW rockets, probably 300 CR a pop.
---- The FLASH rocket launcher, for an explosive weapon that can shoot more than once between reloads. (Maybe ask Yholl if I can borrow the DRLA napalm logic, because I hate dealing with fire effects)
---- Hmm, was I planning a 40mm grenade launcher at all, or did I cannibalize that idea for ww-terror? Maybe pull it over here, toss the upgrades except for the Stabilizing Fins, and make it reload slower?
-- In slot 6:
---- Gauss rifle - graphics/sounds are already in...(see IRC log below)
---- Plasma Gatling - should I just borrow the recolored Doom 2.5 chaingun again, like original ww-cash?
---- Heater Rifle - Same logic as the one in WW-BSNI but with less sucky graphics and animation.
---- Electric Grenades - the ones from ww-terror?
-- In slot 7:
---- Pimp Cane already has graphics, just need to actually code it (Tyrian's coin graphics would make interesting projectiles!)
---- The Golden Gun - High-def Goldeneye model rip might serve as a good base if it can be made detailed enough afterwards.
---- Spectrum Cannon - ask Pillowblaster, I dunno.
-- In slot HELL:
---- The Vendor's Foe upgrade needs some better indication that it exists, maybe some awesome shadowy effects when swinging the crowbar around?
---- Gothmog needs to exist. But first: fire effects? Could I get away with those being projectile trails, or would I need a sprite edit?

MAJOR GAMEPLAY:
* Offhand melee attacks, maybe? ww-cash classic had those.
* Side-idea: offhand melee is a weapon slot of its own, can hold one weapon that takes up Zoom button, must sell melee weapon to buy another. Punches by default; knife, crowbar, and fire axe can replace? (or should fire axe be its own selectable weapon?)
* Not so sure the dual pistols really works; replace that with a burst-fire upgrade instead?
* Durability system needs implementing. Probably have all weapons count durability out of 1000 points, with random chance per shot to be damaged by a point or so.
-- Low durability makes reloads occasionally take longer, weapons occasionally jam, misfire, or fire duds.
-- Durability should probably be shown as a graph, instead of a number, just to keep players guessing.
* Should enemies have rare chance to drop their guns?
-- Malachai's suggestion: have the dying monster check its killer's inventory for the gun they'll drop, and if present, don't drop the gun.
-- Furthermore: dropped weapons have randomized conditions. Example: Zombieman drops a Glox pistol if the player doesn't have one; starting durability is random from 10-80% of what condition it'd be from a shop. Dropped weapons will NEVER be perfect condition; you can only be guaranteed this from a shop.

AESTHETICS:
* Could probably stand to rework the recoil. Move it to a Flash state, probably, so it doesn't clutter up the weapon animations and I can just call it with A_GunFlash?
* Someone (torridGristle?) offered a nicer looking Glox pistol; look into that?
* I'm not sure I like the current Magnum graphics/sounds; maybe replace them with the ones I was using before (Nmn sprites/RE4 sounds?).
* Need to find better fire sound for assault rifle. (Find more way to make it stand out from SMG? Maybe replace the rifle entirely?)

BALANCE ISSUES:
* Seems like the game gets a lot easier later on; maybe raise prices across the board so it takes longer to get the really good guns
* Battle Rifle seems too powerful.
* Lever Action seems less good than the Magnum pistol? Maybe some price/power divergence is in order.

OTHER SHIT I COULD PROBABLY DO:
* Weaker monsters randomly drop useless junk instead of cash. IOU notes, gum wrappers, expired coupons, gift receipts, etc.
* Bigger monsters should occasionally drop really big cash items (Cacoward trophies?) instead of huge piles of small cash.
* Should cash disappear if it lands on liquid flats or gratings? (Maybe after a delay, wet money doesn't ALWAYS equal unusable money)
* It'd be funny if the Wolfenstein Nazis dropped Wolf3D treasures that are worth more money, to give the player a reason to go visit the secret levels. (or alternatively, make for really confusing PWADs.)

THINGS I CAN DO WITH THE HELL VENDOR:
* Make it mutter/whisper infernal things when you're nearby. (Actually, all machines need some kind of ambience.)
* When destroyed, it explodes in a shower of debris and blood.
* When dismantled with the Vendor's Foe (need a better name of that), have it erupt in DRLA Nightmare Archvile fire and say unnerving things at the player.

FROM OLD TODOLIST.TXT FROM PK3:

[21:56:15] <torridGristle> wildweasel, i think that the gauss rifle should use two ammo types to balance out the raw power
[21:56:34] <wildweasel> I'm assuming batteries and the actual projectile?
[21:56:38] <torridGristle> some sort of rifle or magnum ammunition for the projectile and an energy pack
[21:57:02] <torridGristle> and they both drain at different rates so you'll end up reloading twice for two different things
[21:57:11] <wildweasel> What I had in mind was something similar, and you could click-and-hold to charge the weapon up for additional damage/penetration
[21:57:22] <wildweasel> so you could decide to spend more or less battery on one projectile
[21:57:54] <torridGristle> will it be an actual projectile or will it be what you've got for the recoilless rifle
[21:58:05] <torridGristle> because that is really unreliable
[21:58:14] <wildweasel> Was considering a railgun with an actor-based trail, honestly.
[21:59:09] <torridGristle> can you put an impact actor at the end of it? debris and smoke
[21:59:23] <wildweasel> I think railguns support puffs now, so perhaps
[21:59:37] <torridGristle> oh that'd be really cool
[22:00:07] <torridGristle> different actors for different ranges of charge for more of an impact from the higher charge
[22:00:32] <torridGristle> maybe some shrapnel in a small range
