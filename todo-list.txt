Okay I'm really gonna have to keep up to date on this. Here's some shit I could do to ww-cash2...

HIGH PRIORITY:
* Add weapon durability and associated effects.
* The rest of the weapons need adding.
-- In slot 4: hmm, a heavy machinegun of some kind, or would that be redundant?
-- In slot 5: Find better sprites for the Recoilless, add disposable LAWs and the incendiary rockets.
-- In slot 6: Plasma Gatling, Heater Rifle, Gauss Rifle, Plasma Grenades?
-- In slot 7: Pimp Cane, Golden Gun, Spectrum Cannon (ask Pillowblaster?)
-- In slot HELL: Gothmog, maybe get new sprites for the Crowbar upgrade

MAJOR GAMEPLAY:
* Offhand melee attacks, maybe? ww-cash classic had those.
* Side-idea: offhand melee is a weapon slot of its own, can hold one weapon that takes up Zoom button, must sell melee weapon to buy another. Punches by default; knife, crowbar, and fire axe can replace? (or should fire axe be its own selectable weapon?)
* Not so sure the dual pistols really works; replace that with a burst-fire upgrade instead?
* Need to eventually populate the rest of the vending machines with non-placeholder weapons but I feel like I should wait until the shop menu's been replaced first because god damn what a pain
* Disposable weapons, a la Shifter? PS20, etc.? (This is what the energy weapons are supposed to be, when they're implemented. -ww)
* Should dual pistols be tossed in favor of a burst-fire upgrade?

AESTHETICS:
* Could probably stand to rework the recoil. Move it to a Flash state, probably, so it doesn't clutter up the weapon animations and I can just call it with A_GunFlash?
* Someone (torridGristle?) offered a nicer looking Glox pistol; look into that?
* Language strings for shop descriptions need better line breaks; they're escaping the window.
* Maybe find a slightly larger font for them, too? Is the Tyrian font available in BMF? (Yes it is - but would it clash with the Iron Plague/Hard Vacuum stuff?)
* Get actual graphics for the shop menus.
* Lengthen the shop descriptions for anything that had to be cut down for space originally?
* I'm not sure I like the current Magnum graphics/sounds; maybe replace them with the ones I was using before (Nmn sprites/RE4 sounds?).

BALANCE ISSUES:
* Seems like the game gets a lot easier later on; maybe raise prices across the board so it takes longer to get the really good guns
* Battle Rifle seems too powerful.
* Lever Action seems less good than the Magnum pistol? Maybe some price/power divergence is in order.

OTHER SHIT I COULD PROBABLY DO:
* Weaker monsters randomly drop useless junk instead of cash. IOU notes, gum wrappers, expired coupons, gift receipts, etc.
* Bigger monsters should occasionally drop really big cash items (Cacoward trophies?) instead of huge piles of small cash.
* Should cash disappear if it lands on liquid flats or gratings? (Maybe after a delay, wet money doesn't ALWAYS equal unusable money)

DONE (PROBABLY):
* Shop menu needs redoing. Badly. (Thanks, edthebat! -ww 8/8/2015)

FROM OLD TODOLIST.TXT FROM PK3:
Need to find better fire sound for assault rifle. (Find more way to make it stand out from SMG?)

Implement gauss rifle.

Toss recoilless rifle in favor of AT4?

Add plasma gatling or similar?

Make "pimp cane" and golden gun so slot 7 gets actual weapons

[21:56:15] <torridGristle> wildweasel, i think that the gauss rifle should use two ammo types to balance out the raw power
[21:56:34] <wildweasel> I'm assuming batteries and the actual projectile?
[21:56:38] <torridGristle> some sort of rifle or magnum ammunition for the projectile and an energy pack
[21:57:02] <torridGristle> and they both drain at different rates so you'll end up reloading twice for two different things
[21:57:11] <wildweasel> What I had in mind was something similar, and you could click-and-hold to charge the weapon up for additional damage/penetration
[21:57:22] <wildweasel> so you could decide to spend more or less battery on one projectile
[21:57:54] <torridGristle> will it be an actual projectile or will it be what you've got for the recoilless rifle
[21:58:05] <torridGristle> because that is really unreliable
[21:58:14] <wildweasel> Was considering a railgun with an actor-based trail, honestly.
[21:59:09] <torridGristle> can you put an impact actor at the end of it? debris and smoke
[21:59:23] <wildweasel> I think railguns support puffs now, so perhaps
[21:59:37] <torridGristle> oh that'd be really cool
[22:00:07] <torridGristle> different actors for different ranges of charge for more of an impact from the higher charge
[22:00:32] <torridGristle> maybe some shrapnel in a small range
