Okay I'm really gonna have to keep up to date on this. Here's some shit I could do to ww-cash2...

HIGH PRIORITY:
* Add weapon durability and associated effects.
* The rest of the weapons need adding.
-- In slot 4: hmm, a heavy machinegun of some kind, or would that be redundant?
-- In slot 5: Find better sprites for the Recoilless, add disposable LAWs and the incendiary rockets.
-- In slot 6: Plasma Gatling, Heater Rifle, Gauss Rifle, Plasma Grenades?
-- In slot 7: Pimp Cane, Golden Gun, Spectrum Cannon (ask Pillowblaster?)
-- In slot HELL: Gothmog, maybe get new sprites for the Crowbar upgrade

MAJOR GAMEPLAY:
* Offhand melee attacks, maybe? ww-cash classic had those.
* Side-idea: offhand melee is a weapon slot of its own, can hold one weapon that takes up Zoom button, must sell melee weapon to buy another. Punches by default; knife, crowbar, and fire axe can replace? (or should fire axe be its own selectable weapon?)
* Not so sure the dual pistols really works; replace that with a burst-fire upgrade instead?
* Need to eventually populate the rest of the vending machines with non-placeholder weapons but I feel like I should wait until the shop menu's been replaced first because god damn what a pain
* Disposable weapons, a la Shifter? PS20, etc.? (This is what the energy weapons are supposed to be, when they're implemented. -ww)
* Should dual pistols be tossed in favor of a burst-fire upgrade?

AESTHETICS:
* Could probably stand to rework the recoil. Move it to a Flash state, probably, so it doesn't clutter up the weapon animations and I can just call it with A_GunFlash?
* Someone (torridGristle?) offered a nicer looking Glox pistol; look into that?
* Language strings for shop descriptions need better line breaks; they're escaping the window.
* Maybe find a slightly larger font for them, too? Is the Tyrian font available in BMF? (Yes it is - but would it clash with the Iron Plague/Hard Vacuum stuff?)
* Get actual graphics for the shop menus.
* Lengthen the shop descriptions for anything that had to be cut down for space originally?
* I'm not sure I like the current Magnum graphics/sounds; maybe replace them with the ones I was using before (Nmn sprites/RE4 sounds?).

BALANCE ISSUES:
* Seems like the game gets a lot easier later on; maybe raise prices across the board so it takes longer to get the really good guns
* Battle Rifle seems too powerful.
* Lever Action seems less good than the Magnum pistol? Maybe some price/power divergence is in order.

OTHER SHIT I COULD PROBABLY DO:
* Weaker monsters randomly drop useless junk instead of cash. IOU notes, gum wrappers, expired coupons, gift receipts, etc.
* Bigger monsters should occasionally drop really big cash items (Cacoward trophies?) instead of huge piles of small cash.
* Should cash disappear if it lands on liquid flats or gratings? (Maybe after a delay, wet money doesn't ALWAYS equal unusable money)

DONE (PROBABLY):
* Shop menu needs redoing. Badly. (Thanks, edthebat! -ww 8/8/2015)
