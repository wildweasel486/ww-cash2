Okay I'm really gonna have to keep up to date on this. Here's some shit I could do to ww-cash2...

HIGH PRIORITY:
* Shop menu needs redoing. Badly. (Currently have phantombeta looking at it - 7/26/2015)
* Add weapon durability and associated effects.

MAJOR GAMEPLAY:
* Offhand melee attacks, maybe? ww-cash classic had those.
* Side-idea: offhand melee is a weapon slot of its own, can hold one weapon that takes up Zoom button, must sell melee weapon to buy another. Punches by default; knife, crowbar, and fire axe can replace? (or should fire axe be its own selectable weapon?)
* Not so sure the dual pistols really works; replace that with a burst-fire upgrade instead?
* Need to eventually populate the rest of the vending machines with non-placeholder weapons but I feel like I should wait until the shop menu's been replaced first because god damn what a pain

AESTHETICS:
* Could probably stand to rework the recoil. Move it to a Flash state, probably, so it doesn't clutter up the weapon animations and I can just call it with A_GunFlash?
* Someone (torridGristle?) offered a nicer looking Glox pistol; look into that?

BALANCE ISSUES:
* Seems like the game gets a lot easier later on; maybe raise prices across the board so it takes longer to get the really good guns
* Battle Rifle seems too powerful.
* Lever Action seems less good than the Magnum pistol? Maybe some price/power divergence is in order

OTHER SHIT I COULD PROBABLY DO:
* Weaker monsters randomly drop useless junk instead of cash. IOU notes, gum wrappers, expired coupons, gift receipts, etc.
* Bigger monsters should occasionally drop really big cash items (Cacoward trophies?) instead of huge piles of small cash.
