Need to find better fire sound for assault rifle. (Find more way to make it stand out from SMG?)

Implement gauss rifle.

Toss recoilless rifle in favor of AT4?

Add plasma gatling or similar?

Make "pimp cane" and golden gun so slot 7 gets actual weapons

[21:56:15] <torridGristle> wildweasel, i think that the gauss rifle should use two ammo types to balance out the raw power
[21:56:34] <wildweasel> I'm assuming batteries and the actual projectile?
[21:56:38] <torridGristle> some sort of rifle or magnum ammunition for the projectile and an energy pack
[21:57:02] <torridGristle> and they both drain at different rates so you'll end up reloading twice for two different things
[21:57:11] <wildweasel> What I had in mind was something similar, and you could click-and-hold to charge the weapon up for additional damage/penetration
[21:57:22] <wildweasel> so you could decide to spend more or less battery on one projectile
[21:57:54] <torridGristle> will it be an actual projectile or will it be what you've got for the recoilless rifle
[21:58:05] <torridGristle> because that is really unreliable
[21:58:14] <wildweasel> Was considering a railgun with an actor-based trail, honestly.
[21:59:09] <torridGristle> can you put an impact actor at the end of it? debris and smoke
[21:59:23] <wildweasel> I think railguns support puffs now, so perhaps
[21:59:37] <torridGristle> oh that'd be really cool
[22:00:07] <torridGristle> different actors for different ranges of charge for more of an impact from the higher charge
[22:00:32] <torridGristle> maybe some shrapnel in a small range
