The Milkor MGL-140 that I am using was originally a model replacement for
the Firearms mod for Half-Life. It was then modified into a grenade
replacement for Counter-Strike 1.6. Those involved with the model's creation
certainly do deserve credit here, and their names are Ultimate Bastard
Felipe Paiva, Teh Snake, Inph!n!tY, TheLama, DeadPixel, and Racer445.
I screenshotted the model in Jed's HLMV and tweaked the crap out of it
to make it actually look good in ZDoom.
